<ul><li>Variations in <a href="#Sun">the sun's energy</a> reaching Earth</li>
	<li>Changes in the <a href="#Reflectivity">reflectivity</a> of Earth’s atmosphere and surface</li>
	<li>Changes in the <a href="#Greenhouse">greenhouse effect</a>, which affects the amount of heat retained by Earth’s atmosphere</li>
</ul><p>These factors have caused Earth’s climate to change many times.</p>

<p>Scientists have pieced together a record of Earth’s climate, dating back hundreds of thousands of years (and, in some cases, millions or hundreds of millions of years), by analyzing a number of indirect measures of climate such as ice cores, tree rings, glacier lengths, pollen remains, and ocean sediments, and by studying changes in Earth’s orbit around the sun.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p>This record shows that the climate system varies naturally over a wide range of time scales. In general, climate changes prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s can be explained by natural causes, such as changes in solar energy, volcanic eruptions, and natural changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p>Recent climate changes, however, cannot be explained by natural causes alone. Research indicates that natural causes do not explain most observed warming, especially warming since the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. Rather, it is extremely likely that human activities have been the dominant cause of that warming.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a><a id="Greenhouse" name="Greenhouse"></a></p>

	<h2 class="pane-title">Radiative Forcing</h2>

	<div class="pane-content">
			<p>Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence of a particular factor (e.g. GHGs, aerosols, or land use changes) on the net change in Earth’s energy balance. On average, a positive radiative forcing tends to warm the surface of the planet, while a negative forcing tends to cool the surface.</p>

			<p>GHGs have a positive forcing because they absorb energy radiating from Earth’s surface, rather than allowing it to be directly transmitted into space. This warms the atmosphere like a blanket. Aerosols, or small particles, can have a positive or negative radiative forcing, depending on how they absorb and emit heat or reflect light. For example, black carbon aerosols have a positive forcing since they absorb sunlight. Sulfate aerosols have a negative forcing since they reflect sunlight back into space.</p>

			<p>NOAA’s <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/">Annual GHG Index</a>, which tracks changes in radiative forcing from GHGs over time, shows that such forcing from human-added GHGs has increased 27.5 percent between 1990 and 2009. Increases in CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere are responsible for 80% of the increase. The contribution to radiative forcing by CH<sub>4</sub> and CFCs has been nearly constant or declining, respectively, in recent years.</p>

<h2>The greenhouse effect causes the atmosphere to retain heat</h2>

<p>When sunlight reaches Earth’s surface, it can either be reflected back into space or absorbed by Earth. Once absorbed, the planet releases some of the energy back into the atmosphere as heat (also called infrared radiation). Greenhouse gases like water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) absorb energy, slowing or preventing the loss of heat to space. In this way, GHGs act like a blanket, making Earth warmer than it would otherwise be. This process is commonly known as the “greenhouse effect.�?</p>

<h3>The role of the greenhouse effect in the past</h3>

<p>Over the last several hundred thousand years, CO<sub>2</sub> levels varied in tandem with the glacial cycles. During warm "interglacial" periods, CO<sub>2</sub> levels were higher. During cool "glacial" periods, CO<sub>2</sub> levels were lower.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The heating or cooling of Earth’s surface and oceans can cause changes in the natural sources and sinks of these gases, and thus change greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> These changing concentrations are thought to have acted as a positive feedback, amplifying the temperature changes caused by long-term shifts in Earth’s orbit.<a href="#ref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

	<h2 class="pane-title">Feedbacks Can Amplify or Reduce Changes</h2>

	<div class="pane-content">
		<div>
			<p>Climate feedbacks amplify or reduce direct warming and cooling effects. They do not change the planet’s temperature directly. Feedbacks that amplify changes are called positive feedbacks. Feedbacks that counteract changes are called negative feedbacks. Feedbacks are associated with changes in surface reflectivity, clouds, water vapor, and the carbon cycle.</p>

			<p>Water vapor appears to cause the most important positive feedback. As Earth warms, the rate of evaporation and the ability of air to hold water vapor both rise, increasing the amount of water vapor in the air. Because water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this leads to further warming.</p>

			<p>The melting of Arctic sea ice is another example of a positive climate feedback. As temperatures rise, sea ice retreats. The loss of ice exposes the underlying sea surface, which is darker and absorbs more sunlight than ice, increasing the total amount of warming.</p>

			<p>Some types of clouds cause a negative feedback. Warming temperatures can increase the amount or reflectivity of these clouds, reflecting more sunlight back into space, cooling the surface of the planet. Other types of clouds, however, contribute a positive feedback.</p>

			<p>There are also several positive feedbacks that increase GHG concentrations. For example, as temperatures warm:</p>

			<ul><li>Natural processes that are affected by warming, such as permafrost thawing, tend to release more CO<sub>2</sub>.</li>
				<li>The ocean releases CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere and absorbs atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> at a slower rate.</li>
				<li>Several types of land surfaces may release more methane (CH<sub>4</sub>).</li>
			</ul><p>These changes lead to higher concentrations of atmospheric GHGs and contribute to increased warming.<a id="Recent" name="Recent"></a></p>
